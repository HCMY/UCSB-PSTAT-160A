# UCSB-PSTAT-160A
## Stochastic Processes w/ Discrete Variables (a.k.a. Markov chains)
This repo is dedicated to showing the coding assignments I completed during the class PSTAT 160A taught in Fall 2016 by Professor Hohn at UCSB.
I will also be including the pdf documents of the assignments where I was asked to extracted specific answers from the problem in question.

## What are Stochastic Processes?
Stochastic processes involve a finite "state space" through which one can move, 
and the probability of moving from one state to another is constant throughout the process. 

For example, if the state space consists of the states "0", "1", and "2" (The states could be "A"/"B"/"C", or "Home"/"Work"/"Bar"; the states here arbitrary),
and the probability of moving from state "0" to state "1" is 0.30, then for any time 0 <= t <= infinity that probability will always be 0.30.

These types of situations are excellent for modeling repetitive processes in real life scenarios (see below)

## Real Life Applications
There are many real life applications with respect to Markov chains...
